# Isolated-Sign-Language-Recognition-System

About this project:

Isolated sign language recognition is crucial in improving accessibility and communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community, especially for babies born with permanent hearing loss. With the increasing number of such cases, there is a need for technological interventions that can help make learning sign language more interactive and accessible. In this paper, we propose the use of the TensorFlow Object Detection API for isolated sign language recognition using machine learning. The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network to detect and recognize sign language gestures.This technology has the potential to benefit the deaf and hard of hearing community by providing an alternative means of communication and connecting them with their loved ones.
